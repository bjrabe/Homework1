I think of data science as “statistics plus.” Data scientists need to use the methods of statistics for analyzing data, but data scientists also work with messy data that come in a lot of different forms. This requires extra facility with computer science to transform data into forms that can be analyzed with traditional statistical methods. I also think data science is more closely associated with some methods which didn’t clearly originate from classical statistics, such as data mining and machine learning, though lots of folks in statistics training pathways have the option of learning and specializing in these topics in the present day.\n-I view myself as having more of a statistics focus. My interest in statistics developed from my career in medicine. Medicine does have a lot of structured data, so it is one of the domains where classical statistics plays an important role and hasn’t necessarily been incorporated under the data science umbrella. I also have more interest in the mathematical theory of data analysis methods than the practical aspects of working with massive (and possibly unstructured) data sets."
